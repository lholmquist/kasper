### Bug Fixing

I know this comes as a shock to most,  but there were some bugs that were found in our code and this release see those bugs exterminated!

There were also some enhancements to our internal API's.

### Dev Tasks

We have also added a `grunt watch` task for those who are developing AeroGear.js

While running this task,  any changes to the code will run the tests for that code!!

Big thanks to [Tolis Emmanouilidis](https://github.com/tolis-e)

### Code

As always, you can view the source code [here](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js)

If bower is your thing:

    $ bower install aerogear

Or if you want to create a custom build, [JS Custom Builder](http://aerogear.org/download/custom/)

or use can use the `custom` grunt command!!
