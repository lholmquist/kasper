It's no secret that Nutella is the most delicious thing on the planet.  I mean, its been scientifically proven by the pretend survey i had.  

While it can be enjoyed many ways, i was partial to spreading it on toast. Usually 2 pieces would work, and i would spread, lets say, a smattering of Nutella on each.  


### The Discovery

Then one day, while i was waiting for the bread to toast,  i had a bit of an epiphany. I realized that i could just use a spoon instead of putting it on toast.

Not realizing it then, but this simple act would have an order of magnitude change on what i now call "Time to first (hazel)Nut". Actually, thats probably a bad name. So lets just call it, "The Quickening".  And yes, to all you Highlander nerds, i stole that term.

While this was an amazing discovery, i wouldn't be a Good little Software Engineer if i didn't take the time to performance test my new found discovery and make a  graph so i can show it off to my internet peers.


### The Tests

My current Toaster, which is actually, a toaster oven, can make the toast in about 5 minutes.  There is of course some time for the cooldown period, so lets add another minute here for the "not burning your hand" phase.  Then comes the smattering.  lets add another minute here again, just to be sure that all corners are covered.  Then lets add another minute for the walk back to my office, while carefully carrying the toast pieces

So using this formula:

    The_Quickening = Toast + cooldown + smattering + walk_back_office

So using this formula that i just made up:

	5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8
    
We can see that using my current toaster would take 8 minutes for the Nutella to first reach my mouth.

I'm sure there are quicker toasters out there, and according to some googling,  it likes i can get this time down to about 1 minute 30 seconds. So we can use our formula from above.  The time to toast is going to change, but the other numbers are pretty constant, so this would look like:

	1.5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.5
    
 Wow, thats a almost half the time.
 
 Now lets see how the spoon does.
 
 So, Time to toast would be 0, as would the cooldown and smattering.  We can also change the walk to office time to zero also, since eating can commence during the walk.  So we these new numbers:
 
 	0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
    
So there you have it,  it is more efficient to use a spoon to get the Nutella in your mouth than Toast.
