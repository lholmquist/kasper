Recently our [iOS library](http://aerogear-dev.1069024.n5.nabble.com/aerogear-dev-Announcing-AeroGear-iOS-2-0-tp9529.html) announced their 2.0 release.  

Today, i'm happy to announce the release of AeroGear.js 2.0!!

Since this is a Major release, there are changes that will likely break existing code as well as some things that have been removed.

I know you are excited to see what this release is all about, so lets check it out.

## Deprecation

### Pipeline

It is with a heavy heart and even heavier delete key finger, that I say good-bye to our friend, the begining of it all, the underused and overally duplicated,  Pipeline.

It was determined that Pipeline and pipes did not add much value since it was basically a wrapper on top of jQuery Ajax.

So Pipeline and pipes have been completely removed in 2.0

If this was something that you used, they will still live on in the 1.X branch

If you would like to move off of them, then you can still use jQuery.Ajax.  You can find that documentation [here](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/)

### Authentication 

Similar to Pipeline, the Auth module didn't really add any value to the library, so this has also been removed.

Again It will live on in the 1.X branch


## Changes

One big change that i'm excited about is that we decided to fully embrace Promises, specifically ES6 Promises*, where it made sense to through out the library.

Another change is that some of the modules are no longer dependent on the use of jQuery.

Depending on the Module, there have been other specific changes/updates, lets check it out.


*_We use this [es6 polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) in the absence of a native implementation_

### Datamanager

DataManager has fully embraced the Promise.  This means that the callback pattern has been removed.

So for example, in the past you could do something like this:

	dmStore.read({success: function (result) { ... }});
    
Now, you would do this:

	dmStore.read().then(function (result) {...});


Another cool change is that for the IndexedDB and WebSQL adapters, the `auto` param has now been updated to default to `true`.  This means that you no longer have to excplitly call open.

So instead of doing something like this:
	
    idbStore.open(...).then(function () {
    	idbStore.read(...)
    });
    
You can now just do
    
    idbStore.read(...)

And finally, DataManager is no longer dependent on jQuery.

### Ajax Promises

We also updated the internal Ajax library to just use promises also.

This is used by both the UnifiedPush SDK and the Authz OAuth2 module.

Since ES6 promises only have 1 return value we return an object with this signature:

	{
        data: dataOrError, - the data or an error
        statusText: statusText, - the status of the response
        
        agXHR: request - the xhr request object
    };


## Cookbook Examples

The [cookbook examples](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js-cookbook/releases/tag/2.0.0) have all been updated with either the 2.0 library or a deprecation notice


## Integration Tests

Last but not least the Integration tests have been completely reworked, thanks to lfryc!!!


This allows us to squash those bugs, that should never happen but when they do, much easier.


## Code

As always, you can view the source code [here](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js/releases/latest)

If bower is your thing:

    $ bower install aerogear

Or if you want to create a custom build, [JS Custom Builder](http://aerogear.org/download/custom/)

or use can use the `custom` grunt command!!


## Up Next

For the latest, check out our roadmap [here](http://aerogear.org/docs/planning/roadmaps/AeroGearJS/)

But a spoiler alert:  A Start on DataSync/Revision Control and converting to ES6 modules is next!!

So Stay Tuned
