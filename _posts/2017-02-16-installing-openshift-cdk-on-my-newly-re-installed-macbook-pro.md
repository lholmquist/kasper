## Intro and a brief History

Recently I decided to re-install my 2012 Macbook pro.  I got this laptop when I first started at Red Hat about 4 and a half years ago.  During that time, I've had a lot of different things for development installed on it.  

I had thought about this for a while, but didn't want to go through the process of setting things again.  I had recently installed the Openshift CDK and had a succesfully running [Helloworld-MSA demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/redhat-helloworld-msa/helloworld-msa/master/readme.html), so i didn't really want to mess with that.

But then one day i was playing around with and trying to run the tests for our Source-to-image(s2i) [repo](https://github.com/bucharest-gold/origin-s2i-nodejs), and i was getting a failure becuase of a command that wasn't installed called Docker Squash.  

Not really a big deal, so i followed the install instructions,  and i thought i had installed it correctly(it used python),  but i was still getting failures.  As it turns out, i had multiple versions of Python installed.

Unrelated to this, in the past i've also had major issues with Ruby becuase of the same thing.  

This was excuse i needed to start fresh.

I know what you're thinking, i could've spent some time and figured it out,  but i'm also the person who bought a new car becuase i needed to get new brakes.  In that case it actually worked in my favor since i sold the new car a year later, but thats a different story.

Now, I'm not going to go into how to setup a bootable USB with the latest macOS since you can just google that.

### Next Steps

Once I was back up and running(After first login), my main focus was getting that Openshift VM back up and running since i was focusing on the [Node.js microservice](https://github.com/redhat-helloworld-msa/bonjour).

There is a [Prepare Environment](https://cdn.rawgit.com/redhat-helloworld-msa/helloworld-msa/master/readme.html#_prepare_environment) section for setting up the demo, so that is were i started.

#### OC Client
First thing i needed was the Openshift Client(OC cli), which i could just download from github.  But for that to work, it needed to be on my PATH, and it was at this point, that i realized i needed to go download iTerm and setup oh-my-zsh and git(which is part of the xcode command line tools).

So after i got my terminal back to my old configuration(This time i had a very very minimal ~/.zshrc file), I downloaded the OC client, and setup up my PATH.

Running `oc version` gave me something similar

	oc v1.4.1+3f9807a
    kubernetes v1.4.0+776c994
	features: Basic-Auth

#### Hypervisor

Now that i had my OC client working, I moved on to the next part, which was to use "Option 1 - Use CDK".  This requires me to use a Hypervisor(something about this word really annoys me, btw). So since I'm on a Mac and it's free, i chose VirtualBox.

So i go over to the virtual box site and [download the latest version](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), which at the time of this writing is 5.1.4, and install that.  Simple stuff, just follow the bouncing ball to install.

#### Vagrant

The next bullet point in the instructions says i need vagrant.  Simple enough, so i go to the vagrant site and [download the vatest version](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) which was 1.9.1 .  Again, following the bouncing ball the install.

#### CDK

Next up, it was time to [download the CDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/download/), which is really 2 downloads,  the Red Hat Container Tools(i downloaded 2.3.0) and the RHEL Vagrant Box(i downloaded the virtual box image, for obvious reasons)

Once that was all downloaded and unzipped, I followed along to install the vagrant plugins that were needed.  A simple copy and paste of:

`vagrant plugin install vagrant-service-manager vagrant-registration vagrant-sshfs`

And then adding in that RHEL vagrant box. Another copy/paste

`vagrant box add --name cdkv2 <path to downloaded .box file>`

Of course i made sure i also increased the VM_MEMORY to 6000.

The directions also say to export a `SUB_USERNAME` and `SUB_PASSWORD` which are my Red Hat Developer user/password.(Also needed for downloading the CDK, probably forgot to mention that).

Now finally i execute `vagrant up`

And.... I got something sort of unexpected:

	
	~/develop/openshift-cdk/cdk/components/rhel/rhel-ose Â» vagrant up                                                            lucasholmquist@BadMotherfucker
	Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
	There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix
	the following errors and try again:

	VagrantPlugins::Registration::Config:
	* The following settings shouldn't exist: password, username
    
Interesting,  so i removed those exports i did for `SUB_USERNAME` and `SUB_PASSWORD`.  I could just enter them in when prompted, probably.

So after getting rid of those exports, i again run `vagrant up` and after a little while of boot up, i get the "Success" screen.

But i noticed something.  The docs say to now go to https://10.1.2.2:8443/console/ for the Openshift Console.  But, according to this log, i should go to https://10.0.2.15:8443/console/

So i decided to go to both addresses,  but neither one loaded.

Before I did the re-install of the laptop, i had this working,  following the same steps, so why wasn't this working now.  

My first instinct was, maybe i should try the CDK 2.2 version instead, so i did.  But that gave me the same result.  I actually got some more "Vagrant Plugin settings shouldn't exist errors" like last time. So that couldn't be it.

#### Solution

After some googling, I somehow stumbled upon the Installation Guide for the CDK, https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-container-development-kit/2.3/paged/installation-guide/.  So i navigated to the chapter on [installing for MacOS](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-container-development-kit/2.3/paged/installation-guide/chapter-4-installing-container-development-kit-on-macos).

This is when i got to the section on "Additional Software", as i already knew,  i needed to install Virtual Box,  but there was an "Important" box.

You may remember from early in this post, i downloaded the latest version of Virtual Box, which is **not** the version we need.  

So I downloaded this lower verion and installed that.

And then i also saw something else.

My Vagrant version was also wrong.

So i downloaded the "Correct" version and installed it.  Then i went through the steps from earlier with installing the vagrant plugins.  I think i first removed the plugins before i installed the correct version of vagrant then re-installed the plugins, but i can't be certain.

I might have also removed the RHEL vagrant box and re-did that add step too.

Now, this time when i did `vagrant up`, and got success screen, the console link was what i was expecting.  And when i clicked on it.  I got the console i was looking for.


At this point i continued with installing each microservice individually(Which is Option 2 in the docs) to get everything back to where i was.

#### One more thing

So, I was also really hoping that i wouldn't have to install Java, since I'm a node.js dev, and i thought i could get away with it,  but as soon as i got to this [command for deploying the Hola project](https://cdn.rawgit.com/redhat-helloworld-msa/helloworld-msa/master/readme.html#_deploy_project_via_oc_cli) I realized i needed it.  

Although, at first, i thought maybe i wouldn't need it and all the "mvn package -ing" would happen on the "server" side. The Node.js microservice does this actually, it runs `npm install` as part of building the docker image on Openshift.  Perhaps this would too.  Nope.


#### Summary

So in summary, make sure you have Virtual Box 5.0.x and Vagrant 1.8.1
